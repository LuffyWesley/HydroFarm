# HydroFarm
About 70 percent of all the world's freshwater withdrawals go towards irrigation uses. But of the water used for irrigation, only about one-half is reusable. The rest is lost by evaporation into the air, evapotranspiration from plants, or is lost in transit, by a leaking pipe. 

HydroFarm aims to improve water use efficiency without decreasing yield. We will be integrating a weather API with canopy temperature to provide real-time updated irrigation scheduling. This will help small-scale farmers on water costs while potentially using limited water resources for a larger overall yield. 

## Installation Instructions
1. Get an openweather API key
2. TBD
